# Probability and Statistics Review

## Introduction

This is the sub-repository for reviewing probability and statistics, hopefully that I would remember most of concepts, but I might be struggle sometimes.

## How do I initialize this repository?

I am thinking of building an collections of `.md` files for theory and notebooks (if you have heard about Jupyter Notebook or similar things, that is OK, but if not, search for it) for programming practice. All the code will be in Python programming language, but the structure may annoy some Pythonisms :D. Hope you enjoy reading it!
