# The Data Workspace

The self-review workspace for me with the combination of both theoratical and practical works. I will start will some specific tasks and broaden it later. Each week I aim to acquire 1 commit containing the content of that week along with the proposal for the next week. If I am not doing well but you are enjoying it, please email me: dungdore1312@gmail.com :D

## Topics

Currently I am attempting to review the following 3 topics:
1. Probability and Statistics
2. Deep Learning
3. Data Collection (a part of Data Engineering)

## Progress

Week 2 (2022/09/11 - 2022/09/17):
