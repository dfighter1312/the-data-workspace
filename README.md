# The Data Workspace

The self-review workspace for me with the combination of both theoratical and practical works. I will start will some specific tasks and broaden it later. Each week I aim to acquire 1 commit containing the content of that week along with the proposal for the next week. If I am not doing well but you are enjoying it, please email me: dungdore1312@gmail.com :D

## Topics

Currently I am attempting to review the following 3 topics:
1. Probability and Statistics
2. Deep Learning
3. Data Collection (a part of Data Engineering)

## Progress

Week 0 (2022/08/27 - 2022/09/03):
*Why starts with 0? Since indexing starts with 0 too :D*

**Probability and Statistics:** P.0 - Basic concepts reviews

**Deep Learning:** P.0 - Graph Attention Networks reviews and scratch implementation

**Data Collection:** P.0 - Crawler investigation (What crawler do we have? What is special?)
